## Sessions Analytics

### How to run the code

- Install `nodejs` in you computer
- Install yarn by running `npm install --global yarn`
- Run `yarn` to install the dependencies

#### To run in Typescript:

- Run `yarn dev` to initialize

#### Or if you wish to run in javascript compiled code, follow the steps below:

- Run `yarn build` to compile the code
- Run `yarn prod` to run the compiled code

### How to run the tests

- For a normal test you should run `yarn test`
- For a coverage test you should run `yarn test:cov` *

*\*The coverage test basically runs the tests and create a report*

You’re in charge of implementing a new analytics “sessions” view. You’re given a set of data that consists of individual web page visits, along with a visitorId which is generated by a tracking cookie that uniquely identifies each visitor. From this data we need to generate a list of sessions for each visitor.

The data set looks like this:

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "url": "/pages/a-big-river",
      "visitorId": "d1177368-2310-11e8-9e2a-9b860a0d9039",
      "timestamp": 1512754583000
    },
    {
      "url": "/pages/a-small-dog",
      "visitorId": "d1177368-2310-11e8-9e2a-9b860a0d9039",
      "timestamp": 1512754631000
    },
    {
      "url": "/pages/a-big-talk",
      "visitorId": "f877b96c-9969-4abc-bbe2-54b17d030f8b",
      "timestamp": 1512709065294
    },
    {
      "url": "/pages/a-sad-story",
      "visitorId": "f877b96c-9969-4abc-bbe2-54b17d030f8b",
      "timestamp": 1512711000000
    },
    {
      "url": "/pages/a-big-river",
      "visitorId": "d1177368-2310-11e8-9e2a-9b860a0d9039",
      "timestamp": 1512754436000
    },
    {
      "url": "/pages/a-sad-story",
      "visitorId": "f877b96c-9969-4abc-bbe2-54b17d030f8b",
      "timestamp": 1512709024000
    }
  ]
}
```

Given this input data, we want to create a set of sessions of the incoming data. A sessions is defined as a group of events from a single visitor with no more than 10 minutes between each consecutive event. A visitor can have multiple sessions. So given the example input data above, we would expect output which looks like:

```json
{
  "sessionsByUser": {
    "f877b96c-9969-4abc-bbe2-54b17d030f8b": [
      {
        "duration": 41294,
        "pages": [
          "/pages/a-sad-story",
          "/pages/a-big-talk"
        ],
        "startTime": 1512709024000
      },
      {
        "duration": 0,
        "pages": [
          "/pages/a-sad-story"
        ],
        "startTime": 1512711000000
      }
    ],
    "d1177368-2310-11e8-9e2a-9b860a0d9039": [
      {
        "duration": 195000,
        "pages": [
          "/pages/a-big-river",
          "/pages/a-big-river",
          "/pages/a-small-dog"
        ],
        "startTime": 1512754436000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Notes

* Timestamps are in milliseconds.
* Events may not be given in chronological order.
* The visitors in sessionsByUser can be in any order.
* For each visitor, sessions to be in chronological order.
* For each session, the URLs should be sorted in chronological order
* For a session with only one event the duration should be zero
* Each event in a session (except the first event) must have occurred within 10 minutes of the preceding event in the session. This means that there can be more than 10 minutes between the first and the last event in the session.
